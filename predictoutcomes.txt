T-test to test hypothesis that the time of index (more serious and non-index crimes are the same: /nTtest_indResult(statistic=-1.4553981425050551, pvalue=0.14559131169233894)
regression to see if we can predict the time of a crime based on its location, day, and whether it was domestic, an index crime, or resulted in an arrest:
